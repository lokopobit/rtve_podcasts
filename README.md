# rtve_podcasts
Scraper of the podcasts of radio3 (music) of www.rtve.es  

## What is this repository?
RTVE is the acronym for "radio television espaÃ±ola", that is, the public service for radio and television in Spain. Radio3 is the section dedicated to music, which offers programming 24/7. All the issued radio shows are stored in www.rtve.es under the name podcasts. So, this repository is a scraper of this shows, with its corresponding storing folder structure.

WARNING: www.rtve.es defines a strict robots.txt so that they are NOT crawled. However, I started this project before knowing it so I decided to go on and  create a crawler that:
> does NOT obey robots.txt restrictions.  
> changes the user-agent smartly (with the help of scrapy-fake-useragent library).  
> makes use of IP proxies (only if needed).

NOTE: I do NOT use this crawler. Use it under your own responsability. 

For those willing to download some radio shows but don't want to bother the web server I created scrape_podcasts.py, a script that just downloads one sound file.
